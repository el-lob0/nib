# The graphics backen i'll use for future projects


### > open_gl_wrapper:
A middle-man between me and opengl, for simplicity.

### > renderer:
This is where the calculations in my future projects will happen.  
  
Basically it calculates the array of pixels, images to show, and then sends it to my graphics api that does some opengl shenanigans to make it visible.
